# Connect_Four
Implementing jQuery

''About the project :: 
Can be done in many ways, in this project i have tried to use jQuery to the maximum extent possible
Using array data structure the same project can be replicated in a more effecient way, you are welcome to do so.

''Pending error :: 
The event Handler of click is not functioning properly
None of my debugging methods have worked since it never reaches the console.log messages inside the event handler.

''What does this do?? ::
It is a simple connect four game, a replica of the classic.
Every user gets their turn to play one after one.
THe first player to secure four consequetive colored chips, horizontally, vertically, diaganally, wins the game.
It is a two player game.
